# How can I help out?
First off, thank you for wanting to contribute to Moebot's development!
I certainly appreciate it when others want to help moebot be the best bot she can be.
However, in order to be the best bot she can be there needs to be some standards when working on her.

## Setting up moebot locally
Please look at the directions in the README at the root of the project.
This contains all the information necessary to deploy moebot locally.
Please make sure to test moebot locally before opening any pull requests!

## What to contribute
While I appreciate everything that can be added to moebot, I have to draw the line somewhere.
New ideas are always welcome, but please run it by me before adding writing code for new features.
If you don't want to come up with new ideas, feel free to take a look at the Projects tab and grab one of the cards in the TODO column.

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to making moebot the best bot she can be!
